Welcome to the Simon Game project! This classic memory game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and engaging experience.

## About the Game
Simon Game is a test of your memory and pattern recognition skills. The game consists of a series of colored buttons that light up in a specific sequence. Your task is to replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. With each successful round, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging, pushing your memory to its limits.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Click on the colored buttons to repeat the sequence shown by the game.
- **Challenging Levels:** As you progress, the sequences become progressively complex, offering a greater challenge.
- **Strict Mode:** Engage in the ultimate challenge by enabling strict mode, which restarts the game if you make a mistake.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your highest score to beat your personal best.

## How to Play

2. **Watch and Remember:** Observe the sequence in which the buttons light up.
